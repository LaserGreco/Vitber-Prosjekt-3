    "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a technic used to represent a matrix A, but with a lower amount of data. The NMF-representation consists of two non-negative matrices W and H, where the dot product between W and H gives an approximation to the original matrix. Combined, W and H has fewer components than A, and consequently holds lower amounts of data. If A is a m x n matrix, W and H has dimensions, respectively, m x d and d x n. With a larger d, the NMF gives a better approximation to the original data. Normally one chooses a value of d that is much smaller than both n and m. However, it is important to choose a value of d that gives a good representation of A, but do not require considerable computational power. This is something we will look more into. "
